## ConsensusPeak

This is an R Package for calling consensus peaks from multiple biological 
replicates. The program accepts histones or transcription factors, and can
handle >= 2 biological replicates. The consensus peak calling approach depends
on the sample type (histone or TF) and on the number of replicates.


TF, n = 2: Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) thresholding. The analysis can be
performed in a conservative or optimal setting.

TF, n >2: Multiple Sample Peak Calling (MSPC).

Histones: Simple overlap of peaks across different replicates.
