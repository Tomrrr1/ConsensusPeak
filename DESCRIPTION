Description: Generate consensus peak sets from multiple biological replicates. 
  If the data are transcription factors, then Irreproducible Discovery Rate 
  (IDR) thresholding is used to call peaks. Alternatively, if the data are 
  histones, then consensus peaks are simply those that overlap across 
  replicates.
